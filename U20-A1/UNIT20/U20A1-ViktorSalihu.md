## Introduction

### What is Tech Support?
![](techsupportpic.png)
Technical or tech support is a customer communication that companies use to help their users with any issues they are having with a product or service.

Typically this is done by using live chat, email or a phone. The aim is to solve technical problems like installations, issues with logins or other technical difficulties that can harm the user experience. 

### There is a difference between tech support and customer support. 

Most people when they hear the term "tech support" imagine call centres dealing with customers that are having some issues but this is not what tech support means. 

Tech support teams are responsible for handling any installation errors, issues and any other technical problem that is making the user experience bad. 



## P1. Explain the activities involved in IT system management and support. 

In the workspace of its systems management and support, tech support performs quite a few activities to make sure smooth functioning of technology infrastructure and to assist users with any technical issues they may encounter. 

The range of activities are: 

+ **Troubleshooting** - This is diagnosing and resolving hardware, software or network-related issues faced by users. This involves identifying the root cause of a problem, following a systematic approach to address the issue and implementing a solution.

+ **Installation** - Many times, customers can have issues with the installation of a software application, and setting up and configuring hardware devices. This may involve installing necessary drivers, configuring network settings, or customizing user preferences.

+ **Software and Hardware Updates** - Regularly updating and maintaining software, firmware, and hardware components to make sure the systems are up-to-date, secure, and operating efficiently.

+ **Network Support** - Tech support is responsible for monitoring, maintaining, and troubleshooting network infrastructure, such as routers, switches, firewalls, and other networking devices.

+ **User Training** - They also provide training and guidance to users on the correct use of hardware and software, including new technologies and systems. 

+ **Security and Data Protection** - Implementation and maintenance of security measures to protect the IT systems and data from unauthorized access, data breaches and other cyber threats.

+ **Backup and Recovery** - Making sure that data is backed up and can be restored in event of failure, data loss or disaster. 

+ **Performance Monitoring** - Technical support continuously monitors the performance of IT systems to identify any potential capacity issues and other things that might affect the system's stability and performance. 

## P2. Explain the tools and systems that can be used to assist with IT system management and support activities.

+ **Remote desktop** - These tools can be TeamViewer, AnyDesk or Microsoft Desktop. These tools enable tech support to remotely access and control a user's computer to diagnose and resolve issues.

+ **Ticketing systems** - Tech support uses ticketing systems, like Jira Service Management, Zendesk, or ServiceNow, to manage and track user-reported issues, assign tasks to team members, and document resolutions.

+ **Monitoring tools** - Monitoring tools can be Nagios, Zabbix, or PRTG, they help the teams to keep an eye on the performance and health of IT systems and infrastructure, they do that by providing alerts when issues result and offer insights into potential problems. 
  

+ **Network management** - SolarWinds, Cisco DNA Center, or Paessler PRTG Network Monitor manage, monitor and troubleshoot network devices making sure optimal performance and security.

+ **Configuration** - Ansible, Puppet, or Chef are tools of configuration management tools that help IT professionals to automate the process of configuring deploying and managing software and hardware across multiple systems. 

+ **Antivirus scans** - Maintaining the protection and stability of computer systems, networks, and data requires regular antivirus scans. They entail using security software to scan applications, files, and other computer parts for malware, such as viruses, worms, ransomware, trojans, and other potentially harmful programs.
